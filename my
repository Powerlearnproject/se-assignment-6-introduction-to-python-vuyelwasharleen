1. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it popular among developers. Some of its key features include an easy-to-read syntax, dynamic typing, and an extensive standard library that supports various programming tasks. Python is effective in diverse use cases such as web development (using frameworks like Django and Flask), data analysis (with libraries like Pandas and NumPy), machine learning (using TensorFlow and scikit-learn), and automation/scripting.

2. To install Python on Windows, download the installer from the official Python website, run the installer and follow the instructions, making sure to choose to add Python to the PATH. On macOS, you can use Homebrew by running brew install python. On Linux, use your distribution's own package manager, such as sudo apt-get install python3 for Ubuntu. To verify the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type python --version or python3 --version. You can set up a virtual environment with python -m venv myenv (or python3 for macOS/Linux) and activate it with myenv\Scripts\activate on Windows or myenv/bin/activate source on macOS/Linux.

3. A simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console is:
print("Hello, World!")
This program uses the print function, which outputs text to the console. The text to be printed is enclosed in double quotes and passed as an argument to the function.

4. Python's basic data types include integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), and booleans (bool). Here’s a short script demonstrating variables of different data types:
integer_var = 10
float_var = 10.5
string_var = "Hello"
boolean_var = True

print(integer_var)
print(float_var)
print(string_var)
print(boolean_var)
This script declares variables of different data types and prints their values.

5. Conditional statements and loops are fundamental control structures in Python. An if-else statement allows you to execute code based on a condition:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
A for loop enables you to iterate over a sequence:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
This loop prints the numbers 0 to 4.

6. Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are useful for organizing and reducing code duplication. Here’s a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)
This function is called with the arguments 3 and 5, and the result 8 is printed.

7. lists and dictionaries are both data structures in Python but serve different purposes. A list is an ordered collection of elements, while a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Here’s a script demonstrating basic operations on both:
# List example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)

# Dictionary example
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
person['email'] = 'alice@example.com'
print(person)
This script adds an element to a list and a key-value pair to a dictionary.

8. Exception handling in Python allows you to manage errors gracefully using try, except, and finally blocks. Here’s an example:
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("Execution completed")
This script attempts to divide by zero, catches the ZeroDivisionError, and prints a message, ensuring the finally block executes regardless of the error.

9. Modules and packages help organize Python code into manageable sections. A module is a single Python file, while a package is a collection of modules in a directory. You can import a module using the import statement. For example, to use the math module:
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))
This script imports the math module and uses its sqrt function to compute the square root of 16.

10. Reading from and writing to files in Python is straightforward. To read a file’s content and print it to the console:
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:

content = file.read()
    print(content)
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

To write a list of strings to a file:

lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')
These scripts demonstrate basic file input and output operations, with the with statement ensuring proper file handling.
